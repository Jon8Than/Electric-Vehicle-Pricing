## Short Summary of the dataset
  The dataset is a dataset filled with information about some of the electric vehicles on the market today. The last time this dataset was updated with new information was about two years ago (2020). This dataset consist of key factors that customers are interested in when purchasing an electric vehicle. Electric vehicles is a continuing growing transportation market. Therefore, I strongly believe that this dataset will be continued to be updated as the newer electric cars arrive on the market.
